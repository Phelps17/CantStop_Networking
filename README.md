#CantStop_Networking

This started as an old class project I built to run a game of Can't Stop between 2-4 players. The goal of the project is to translate my old project into a new network application. In order to do this, I plan to build a game server to host games and a client to allow players to play over a network.

All files are my own work with the exception of gui.java, StartupDialog.java, and Util.java which credits for go to Debra Deppler and her TAs at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

#To Play

- You can play Can't Stop with 2 to 4 players by running the original program through CantStop.java
- Multiplayer, multigame hosting server is currently being developed
- Networked game client coming soon
